# dotfiles

This is a personal repository for my configuration files found under `$HOME`

I use my own [dotfile-manager] to manage/deploy my dotfiles.

Configuration is included for:

* [Alacritty] - cross-platform, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator
* [bat] - a cat(1) clone with wings
* [browsh] - a fully-modern text-based browser, rendering to TTY and browsers
* [bspwm] - tiling window manager based on binary space partitioning
* [makepkg] - script to automate the building of pacman packages
* [Neofetch] - command-line system information tool
* [Polybar] - fast and easy-to-use status bar
* [sxhkd] - simple X hotkey daemon
* [tmux] - terminal multiplexer
* [Vim] - the ubiquitous text editor
* [Zsh] - Z shell
